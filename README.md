# Flow

Flow plug-in for Unreal Engine provides a graph editor tailored for scripting flow of events in virtual worlds. It's based on a decade of experience with designing and implementing narrative in video games. All we need here is simplicity.

# Plugin moved to the FlowGraph repository
Many people asked to move plugin to the repository that would only contain the Flow plugin itself.
I did exactly that. Moved the plugin with entire history of changes, roadmap, issue and wiki.

* New repository including only the Flow plugin: [FlowGraph](https://github.com/MothCocoon/FlowGraph)
* The second repository where I gonna put sample modues containting quest or dialogue systems: [FlowSamples](https://github.com/MothCocoon/FlowSamples)

This repository might be be updated in the future, used mostly to create "Getting started" project. So it would help to evaluating the plugin!
Repositories above would be imported as git submodules.
